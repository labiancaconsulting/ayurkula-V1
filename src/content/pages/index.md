**‘Ayur’** (life and longevity) and **‘kula’** (family) is a global community for sharing ideas on wellness, incorporating Ayurveda* and other ancient knowledge systems.

In an era defined by lifestyle diseases, strained food systems, and mental stress, we tie science with ancient wisdom to help humans flourish. Our goal is to seed health and wellness at a community level. 

We meet periodically for virtual/in person discussions and practice on the mind and body, including nutrition, breath work/meditation.
