At Ayurkula, we connect science & ancient wisdom to help people live healthy lives. Whether you are a beginner or advanced learner, we sincerely hope you will light a path for others to follow.

Interested in learning the Ayurvedic approach to general wellness, tuning your lifestyle and diet to your doshas, practicing breathwork, and more?

We will share information about periodic workshops/zoom meetings on topics may include:
-Discussing principles of nutrition, digestion, and more
-Practicing pranayama and mindfulness together to aid sleep and mental health
-Ascertaining our doshas and learning how to interpret them
-Cooking food that suits our individual stories (season, location, mental/physical health, time of day etc)
-Deep-dive sessions into a wellness topic.

Currently there is no fixed cost per session, but contributions are welcome to help us take this initiative forward.
