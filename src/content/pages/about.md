I have been passionate about mind and body wellness since my days in college. As a young adult, I often made trips to the Allahabad railway station on my motor-cycle, slipping a one Rupee coin into the weighing machine to visit a small decrepit book-store on platform number one to add to my collection of books on philosophy, mind, and health.

Over the years I continued to connect the dots between yoga, Ayurveda, natural healing, epigenetics, nutrition, exercise, meditation, and mind. How would half-peeled garlic clove have an entirely different impact on my gut bacteria? Why might multi-strain yogurt not actually work? After my wife was diagnosed with cancer, I discovered the amazing immunity-boosting impact of natural foods. Today, my experiential approach combines Western and traditional practices, integrating my knowledge from a series of certificate courses I completed from leading medical universities such as Johns Hopkins, Wageningen, Colorado Boulder, Edinburgh, Stanford and Technion as well as ayurveda from American School of Vedic Studies. My learning has been deeply influenced by my late uncle Prof. G.C Pande, Prof. Subhash Kak, Dr. David Frawley and Prof. Sthaneshwar Timalsina. Their wonderful writings and conversations continue to lead me beyond.

In a previous life, I worked for over two decades in[ finance](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rajatbhu/), traversing a commercial bank, rating agency, investment bank and hedge fund, both in India and the US. Alongside my business career, I have been involved with various community initiatives, spearheading carbon-footprint reductions and nonprofit donation drives in my town. In an attempt to create broader change, I created theHOBMOB.com to try to seed a place for meaningful dialogue on social media. I have since been using my skills and knowledge to educate some of my friends facing life threatening diseases like cancer, promoting both nutritional and lifestyle changes and the [COVID crisis](http://ayurkula.org/2020/03/06/is-ayurveda-even-relevant-for-coronavirus/). 

The reasons for disease and suffering are not complicated or hidden. If you are ready to introspect, we can begin the journey to better living. Sustainable human health and the future of our planet are closely intertwined. 

As I say in Sanskrit:

“तत्  रक्षति स्वास्थ्य,

रक्षति भू काशिष्यते”

“That which sustains health,

Will sustain the planet”

Dr. Krishnan is an experienced Āyurveda paediatrician and an expert in Āyurvedic dietetics based in Bengaluru. She believes that an integrative framework holds the keys to future of medicine in general and in understanding the jargonistic area of precision nutrition in particular. She has a special interest in educating mothers about the advantages of Ayurveda techniques in post-natal infant care. Her research interests include management of children with special needs-cerebral palsy, autism etc.

Some fun facts- she is a polyglot, a hiker who can probably beat you at squash and meditate while doing pottery glazes.

Madhumita Krishnan is not a medical doctor or physician. By no means is this to be confused with becoming a medical doctor (MD) in USA which requires a whole other level of training and licensure. Madhumita will only be participating in educational events and workshops.
